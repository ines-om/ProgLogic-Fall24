# Logic in Programming Project - Fall 24

Implemented a program in Prolog to solve "Star Battle" puzzles.
Encoded the "Star Battle" puzzle rules, ensuring compliance with constraints for placing stars.
Implemented specific functionalities, including:
- Visualization of game states.
- Insertion of stars and points on the board.
- Querying the board for object locations and states.
- Strategies to solve the puzzle partially or fully, focusing on non-trial-and-error methods.
